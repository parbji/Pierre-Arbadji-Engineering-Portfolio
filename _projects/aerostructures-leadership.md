title: "Aerostructures Subteam Lead – McGill Rocket Team"
description: "Conceiving, designing, and validating major structural components for competitive university rocketry. Leading a large student team and multiple manufacturing/analysis projects."
timeline: "Sept 2023 – Present"

As subteam lead, I guide the design and delivery of all primary rocket structures and interfaces for McGill’s competitive launches. This includes everything from composite tank development, coupling systems, to critical load-bearing bulkheads and specialty interfaces. My role balances technical modeling, detailed FEA, hands-on prototyping, and training/mentoring our group of over 50 engineering students.

My biggest contribution to the team is connecting classroom knowledge with real aerospace manufacturing—scoping objectives, leading brainstorming and modeling in Siemens NX and SolidWorks, validating important designs with detailed finite element analysis, and coordinating everything from composite layups to mechanical assembly/test.

We iteratively improved our core designs: composite tanks, bulkheads, and coupling solutions, all of which had to be both light and manufacturable. Our latest coupling ring, for example, solves historic alignment issues for field assembly and dramatically shortens build times. Process improvements and careful QA have cut scrap and unpredictable failures.

Through these projects, I’ve learned how to:
- Direct a large multidisciplinary team (communication and clear planning are as important as technical skills)
- Push topology optimization for thin-walled, high-load structures
- Manage sponsor expectations and budget/funding for research, competitions, and tooling
- Guide composite layup and post-processing to aerospace QA standards
- Analyze joints for both concentricity and force distribution, using nonlinear FEA
- Deliver documents and technical presentations to external judges, sponsors, and the university
