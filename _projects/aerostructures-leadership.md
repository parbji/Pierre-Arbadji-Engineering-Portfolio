# Aerostructures Optimization & Team Leadership

As the Aerostructures Subteam Lead for the McGill Rocket Team, I drive the entire lifecycle of advanced aerospace structural designs, from initial concept, CAD modeling, materials selection, FEA validation, to final manufacturing and integration in competition rockets. I lead a team of 50+ students and coordinate our efforts across multiple concurrent projects, guiding technical development, mentoring members, and setting the foundation for high-reliability, manufacturable structures.

## Programmatic Vision & Team Impact

My leadership revolves around building high-performing teams, implementing rigorous design workflows, and instituting best practices in composite fabrication, quality control, and digital manufacturing. I set the technology roadmap for aerostructures development, facilitate sponsor and industry partnerships, and integrate cross-team workflows to ensure our solutions connect with propulsion, avionics, and mission operations requirements. My approach ensures our projects stay on-track, within budget, and ready for key flight milestones.

## Coupling System Innovation: Design, Assembly & Structural Validation

A standout achievement is the design and qualification of a new primary coupling system to join large-diameter carbon fiber rocket tubes. Previously, coupling required drilling and aligning 16 or more holes through composite tubes,a process prone to tooling errors, lost concentricity, and significant manufacturing downtime. 

My solution is a precision-machined coupling ring that eliminates error-prone drilling and fastener alignment:

- The ring epoxy-bonds (Loctite/Hysol EA-9394 Aero) to the flat part of each tube, with each flat ensuring a precise, concentric joint.
- Assembly time and geometric consistency are dramatically improved.
- The screw angles are engineered for optimal load transfer and are designed to safely sustain maximal launch and recovery forces, with a factor of safety >4 for the adhesive and joint, providing conservative reliability for our first use in flight.

## Advanced FEA: Tension & Compression

To validate this innovation, I performed extensive FEA (Finite Element Analysis) for both tension and compression on the coupling system. Simulations confirmed that all load paths, fastener stresses, adhesive interfaces, and tube join lines met or exceeded required factors of safety for launch environments. The new system maintains perfect tube concentricity,the critical design requirement.
