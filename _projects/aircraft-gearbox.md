This project required developing a power transmission system for a small aircraft, a high-torque, high-reliability geartrain capable of safely moving mechanical power from a turbine to a propeller. We began with a rigorous set of technical requirements: gear ratios, shaft strengths, fatigue safety factors, service life, and strict limitations on mass and envelope.

Using AGMA standards, I sized every gear for bending and contact stresses, documented material selection, and worked out bearing arrangements for both radial and axial loads. The design journey involved iterative CAD (SolidWorks) modeling of shaft networks, gear meshes, and bearing locations, followed by FEA to confirm housing stiffness and gear tooth robustness.

Along the way, every design decision was justified not just by calculation, but by manufacturability and real aerospace best practices, accounting for tolerancing, surface finish, and inspection needs. We produced clear technical drawings for all components, and laid out assembly sequences, fastening strategies, and lubrication plans.

The final gearbox delivered a solution capable of transmitting more than 1000hp at 15:1 reduction, meeting life and safety requirements. Full documentation (attached in PDF) covers every rationale, drawing, and analytical justification.

From this project, I learned:
- The workflow from requirements documentation through iterative machine design and CAD assembly
- Real AGMA gear sizing calculation and how to think about failure modes under real use cases
- Integrating detailed FEA and material selection into designs that could actually be manufactured and inspected

The project gave me experience in technical reporting, collaboration in a multi-person design team, and defending decisions to academic and technical reviewers. It represents a complete start-to-finish mechanical design cycle for an aerospace system.
