This project involved designing a gearbox to transfer power efficiently from a turbine engine to a propeller in a small aircraft. The work covered geartrain architecture, gear and shaft sizing, bearing selection, manufacturing detailing, and assembly integration. The gearbox ensures load transfer under high torque while meeting strict aerospace safety margins.

Skills/learning: AGMA gear design, solid modeling, FEA of gear teeth and housing, technical documentation, working to real-world tolerances.

From this challenge, I learned:
- Full workflow for mechanical power transmission and gear sizing
- How to balance weight, lifespan, and reliability for flight components
- Writing structured technical reports for design justification
