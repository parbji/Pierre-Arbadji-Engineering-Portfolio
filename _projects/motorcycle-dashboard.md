This project set out to tackle a high-impact challenge in motorcycle safety: how to proactively warn riders about road hazards by integrating sensor-driven alerts directly into the dashboard. Our group followed a robust engineering design workflow from first principles and market analysis through to technical concept selection and high-level feasibility work.

Work began with requirements engineering and user interviews, understanding what real motorcyclists needed, what distracted them, and how alert timing might affect their reactions. We built feature matrices and weighed options for integrating camera, radar, and proximity sensors, always considering ergonomics, cost, and real manufacturability.

Technical tools included system block diagrams, morphological charts, and Pugh matrices, which let us clearly rank creative solutions. We ultimately selected a dashboard screen with multi-sensor data fusion alerts as the best balance of clarity, technical risk, and cost. Then we iterated on physical interface design, optimizing icons, display contrast, and placement so warnings would be visible in all light conditions but never distracting.

We justified every key choice with a mix of qualitative (human factors, usability studies) and quantitative analysis (component cost, reliability, manufacturability). The resulting system architecture connected sensor blocks, processing modules, and user display using industry-standard connectors and protocols.

From this project I developed:
- Practical skills in requirements engineering, stakeholder communication, and technical documentation
- Experience comparing market and technical constraints using multi-criteria decision matrices
- The ability to present and defend designs with real engineering logic, balancing innovation and feasibility
- A deeper respect for human-machine interface design and user-centered engineering

In the end, we delivered not just a theoretical concept, but an actionable technical proposal, with sketches, interface mockups, and an implementation roadmap for eventual real-world prototyping.
