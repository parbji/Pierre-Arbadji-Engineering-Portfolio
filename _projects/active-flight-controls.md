This research internship focused on the design, modeling, and validation of an active roll-control system for small model rockets using fin-mounted control surfaces. Supported by an $11,500 funding grant from the McGill Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS), this project aimed to develop reliable attitude stabilization methods through precise mechanical control.

The work began with extensive literature review and the derivation of roll-axis dynamic equations tailored for our specific rocket platform. I developed a closed-loop PID control algorithm, incorporating sensor feedback to ensure the rocket maintains controlled attitude throughout flight.

Key stages included:

- **Mathematical Modeling:** Formulating the roll-axis dynamics using classical mechanics and control theory, establishing a framework for controller design.
- **Control Algorithm Design:** Implementing and tuning PID parameters through simulation using MATLAB/Simulink to meet stability and responsiveness requirements.
- **Hardware Prototyping:** Designing the fin-actuation mechanism with a mechanically-linked single-servo configuration, maximizing reliability and minimizing complexity.
- **Experimental Setup:** Constructing a ground test rig to verify actuator performance, sensor accuracy, and control response prior to flight testing.
- **Validation:** Comparing physical data against simulations to confirm model accuracy and controller effectiveness, and iteratively refining parameters and mechanical designs.

The project culminated in rigorous performance evaluation, demonstrating robust roll stabilization across multiple test flights and environmental conditions. Comprehensive documentation was prepared, encompassing methodology, simulations, hardware design, and test results.

Lessons learned and expertise gained include:

- Mastery of dynamic system modeling and control theory as applied to aerospace rolling moments.
- Integration of simulation software with hardware prototyping for iterative system development.
- Practical experience in rapid prototyping, sensor interfacing, and experimental test design.
- Grant proposal writing, budget management, and scholarly reporting in an undergraduate research context.

This experience laid a strong foundation in aerospace controls, system engineering, and research methodology—skills directly transferable to future aerospace design and analysis challenges.
