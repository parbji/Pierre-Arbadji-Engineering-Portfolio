My goal for this project was to develop a mechanically efficient bracket for a specified load and displacement, a component that could be reliably manufactured using laser cutting and that would pass stringent physical testing. The work started with analytical calculations mapping basic load paths and anticipated stress concentrations, followed by advanced geometry design in SolidWorks.

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used throughout: I performed mesh convergence studies to ensure simulated results were physically meaningful and iterated the shape to spread loads efficiently. I balanced performance with fabrication constraints, always checking that every detail could actually be produced on a standard acrylic sheet, and that the bracket wouldn’t fail under a 300N load applied at a specific location.

Once cutting and assembly were complete, I set up a real-world testing regime: mounting the bracket in a custom fixture and applying controlled loads while recording displacement and failure characteristics. The test results aligned closely with FEA predictions, confirming both simulation accuracy and the safety margins built into the design.

Technically, I learned:
- How to optimize geometry for manufacturability and stress distribution, not just theory
- How FEA settings and mesh size can skew results, and how to calibrate them to match experiments
- How brittle polymers behave under load and how to plan for real-world breakages in test setups

The report included detailed documentation, from load schematics through to displacement/force graphs, ready to be reviewed by academic supervisors as well as future engineering teams. My work produced a bracket that met all criteria for safety, manufacturability, and performance, giving me confidence in bridging simulation and physical reality.
