title: "Polaris Flight – Co-founder & Mechanical Lead"
description: "Development and integration of custom rocket airframe and multi-axis flight control surfaces."
timeline: "Sept 2025 – Present"

Polaris Flight was founded to validate a custom-designed 3-axis aerodynamic control system for high-performance student rockets. My focus is leading the mechanical side, designing and building the airframe and structural component, ensuring reliability for in-flight actuation via servo and linkage systems.

I’ve learned how to:
- Integrate design, analysis, and hardware for full-system prototyping
- Shape and refine control surface geometry for combined yaw, pitch, and roll authority
- Apply systems engineering from CAD through bench test and launch
- Communicate with engineers from software, controls, and manufacturing backgrounds
