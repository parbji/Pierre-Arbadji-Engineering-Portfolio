# Polaris Flight - Advanced Flight Control System

## Project Overview

As Co-Founder and Mechanical Lead of Polaris Flight, I'm developing a comprehensive rocket system specifically designed to validate our proprietary 3-axis PID flight controller. This project represents the intersection of advanced control theory, aerodynamic optimization, and precision mechanical design.

## Technical Approach

### Airframe Design
- **Aerodynamic Optimization:** Complete CFD analysis and wind tunnel validation
- **Structural Integrity:** FEA verification across all flight loads and conditions
- **Control Authority:** Optimized fin and control surface sizing for maximum controllability
- **Weight Optimization:** Balanced approach between structural requirements and performance

### Control System Integration
- **3-Axis Control:** Custom PID algorithms for yaw, pitch, and roll stabilization
- **Servo Integration:** Precision servo-actuated control surfaces with real-time feedback
- **Sensor Fusion:** IMU integration for accurate flight state estimation
- **Ground Testing:** Comprehensive validation through bench and environmental testing

### Manufacturing Strategy
- **Rapid Prototyping:** 3D printing for initial validation components
- **Production Methods:** Composite layup for final flight articles
- **Quality Control:** Systematic testing protocols for all subsystems

## Current Status

**Phase:** Transitioning from finalized design to fabrication
**Next Milestone:** Ground testing and static fire trials
**Target:** Summer flight testing campaign

## Key Achievements

- Complete CAD model validation through simulation
- Successful control algorithm development and simulation testing
- Integrated system architecture design
- Manufacturing process optimization
